I’m Shaimaa Khattab, a security explorer, bug hunter, and lifelong learner. 

This blog is my personal space to document and share:  
- Security research, penetration testing notes, and write-ups  
- Insights from bug bounty hunting and real-world vulnerabilities  
- Learning resources and reflections as I grow in the field

If you’re curious about security, bug hunting, or simply exploring how systems work (and fail), you’ll find something here for you.
